      <h1>About MysticMood</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to <strong>MysticMood</strong> — your magical companion for emotional awareness and self-discovery. Inspired by ancient grimoires, glowing orbs, and celestial journeys, MysticMood transforms mood tracking into an enchanted ritual.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are a small, passionate team of creators, designers, and mental wellness advocates who believe that understanding your emotions doesn’t have to feel clinical — it can feel magical. MysticMood was born from a love for fantasy worlds and a desire to help others connect with their inner landscape in a more beautiful, intuitive way.
      </p>

      <p>
        With tools like the <em>Soul Codex</em>, <em>Emotional Grimoire</em>, and <em>Mood Map</em>, our app invites you to chart your emotional path like constellations in the sky. No pressure. No judgment. Just space to feel, reflect, and grow.
      </p>
