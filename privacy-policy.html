      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

      <p>This Privacy Policy explains how MysticMood ("we", "our", or "us") handles your information when you use our app. Your emotional journey is deeply personal, and your privacy matters to us.</p>

      <h2>1. We Don’t Collect Personal Data</h2>
      <p>MysticMood does not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information. Your mood logs and emotional reflections stay entirely on your device, unless you choose to back them up through your own means.</p>

      <h2>2. No Account Required</h2>
      <p>You can use MysticMood fully without signing up or creating an account. This ensures a distraction-free, anonymous experience.</p>

      <h2>3. Local Storage Only</h2>
      <p>All mood entries, reflections, and insights are saved locally on your device. We do not have access to this information and do not transmit it to any servers.</p>

      <h2>4. No Ads, No Tracking</h2>
      <p>MysticMood is ad-free and does not use any third-party analytics or tracking software. We believe in creating a serene, uninterrupted space for your self-discovery.</p>

      <h2>5. Optional Feedback</h2>
      <p>If you choose to contact us (e.g., for support or feedback), we may receive your email address and the message content you send—but we do not use this information for any purpose other than to respond to your inquiry.</p>

      <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>MysticMood is not designed for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from users in this age group. If you believe a child has used the app and submitted personal data, please contact us so we can delete it.</p>

      <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy in the future to reflect changes in app functionality or privacy practices. We encourage you to review this page periodically. Continued use of the app after changes are made indicates your acceptance of those changes.</p>

      <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
      <p>If you have any questions or concerns about your privacy, feel free to reach out to us at <a href="mailto:creatfinity@gmail.com">creatfinity@gmail.com</a>.</p>
